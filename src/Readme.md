# Source Directory

The source code is in the `src` directory.

The code is written in JavaScript. Run the file with command in the format:
`node extract_logs.js YYYY-MM-DD`

Example:
`node extract_logs.js 2024-12-01`

# Important: 
## The input file should be named `test_logs.log` and should be in the same directory as `extract_logs.js` file i.e., in the `/src` directory.

That generates the file in the `/output` directory.
