This method extracts log entries from large files quickly with little RAM consumption. The script reads the log file **line by line** through Node.js's built-in **`readline`** module, thus eschewing the need for loading the entire file into memory. As such, it is highly scalable for dealing with huge datasets.  

Using **`fs.createReadStream`**, the script will read the file in chunks to limit the load on the RAM. It then filters out those entries that do match the given date, thus **accurately extracting** the logs that are relevant to the task in hand. The filtered data will then be written into an output file asynchronously, and will thus not be a cause of performance bottlenecks.  

This solution is also **modular and reusable**, meaning it could be easily adapted to accommodate different log formats or storage requirements. It is equipped to deal with error scenarios with ease, such as files not being found or inappropriate input formats.  

All in all, this method is **fast, memory-efficient, and scalable** and arises thus as an ideal tool for **real-world log processing tasks** in large-scale systems and high-throughput applications. ðŸš€
